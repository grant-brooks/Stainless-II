##No Advertisements

Get used to ***never*** seeing an advertisement before, after, or during a video again. 

##Inspired by Stainless

The extremely quick loading times that have been praised in **Stainless** are built right into **Prodigus**.

##What's New

###Video Minimization.
With video minimization, you can view your favorite content without ever missing a beat. Minimizing videos means that you will be able to watch a video while looking for others.

###Custom Controls.
A more responsive and arguably nicer looking player control scheme has been added to **Prodigus**, allowing you to do more with your videos and have a better experience while doing so. 

###Landscape Fullscreen.
The landscape switching issues that previously plagued **Prodigus** have been fully fixed. To enter fullscreen mode on a video, just tilt your device into landscape mode; the video will adjust its size accordingly.
